# Getting started

Getting started is straightforward, just write SEL expression using Java syntax.

## Hello world example

```yaml
Workflow:
  '!foo': String.join(' ', 'hello', 'world');
  ...
```

## Test expressions locally or in pylon

To be added...

## Best practice

* Add comments in the expression if it helps. 
    * SEL supports Java style comments
        * single line: `// ...`
        * multi-line: `/* ... */`

...
